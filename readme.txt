WP TO DYNAMIC HTML – PORTABLE EXPORT
====================================

Overview
--------

This folder was generated by the "WP To Dynamic HTML (Portable Export)" plugin.
It contains static HTML copies of selected WordPress pages and posts, plus an
assets folder with CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts.

The exported files are designed to be portable:
- No hard‑coded server paths inside the ZIPs.
- Internal links rewritten to local .html files.
- Assets referenced via relative paths under assets/.

Folder contents
---------------

You should see some or all of the following:

- index.html
  The exported home page of the site (either a static front page or the
  posts index, depending on the WordPress "Reading" settings at export time).

- *.html
  One HTML file per exported page or post. File names are based on the
  original WordPress slugs (for example: about.html, contact.html,
  trading-journal-as-of-1-aug-2025.html).

- assets/
    css/
    js/
    images/
    fonts/
  Copied theme/plugin assets that were referenced by the exported pages.

- wp-export-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-partN.zip
  Split ZIP archives containing the exported HTML. Each part is kept below
  approximately 8 MB raw size so that the final ZIP files remain under
  a 9 MB hosting/upload limit.

- wp-export-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-assets-partN.zip
  Split ZIP archives containing the assets/ folder, also kept below the
  same size threshold when splitting was enabled at export time.

How to deploy locally
---------------------

1. Extract all HTML and asset ZIP files into the same folder.
2. Confirm that you see:
   - index.html
   - other .html files (e.g., about.html, contact.html, journal pages)
   - an assets/ directory with css, js, images, fonts subfolders.
3. Open index.html in a browser (double‑click or drag into a browser window).
4. Navigate using the links as you would on the original site.

How to deploy to a web host
---------------------------

1. Extract all ZIP parts on your computer into a single folder.
2. Upload everything from that folder (all .html files and the assets/
   directory) to the document root or a subfolder on your static hosting:
   - Example: public_html/ or public_html/trade-journal/
3. If you upload to a subfolder, the URL to access the exported site will be:
   - https://yourdomain.com/subfolder/index.html
4. Make sure directory names and file names are preserved exactly (case
   sensitive on many Linux hosts).

Home page and internal links
----------------------------

- The WordPress home URL is always exported as index.html.
- All internal links to pages and posts are converted to their corresponding
  .html files:
  - WordPress front page → index.html
  - /about/ → about.html
  - /contact/ → contact.html
  - /trading-journal-as-of-1-aug-2025/ → trading-journal-as-of-1-aug-2025.html
- Remaining absolute references to the original site URL are stripped or
  converted to relative paths wherever possible.

Export limits and notes
-----------------------

- Each static page/post is rendered using the active WordPress theme at
  export time, using the appropriate template (page.php, single.php, or
  index.php as a fallback).
- Assets larger than 5 MB are skipped to keep export and ZIP operations
  within hosting execution and size limits.
- ZIP splitting is configured so that each part remains below roughly 8 MB,
  providing headroom under a 9 MB per‑file limit.
- Server‑side scripts (PHP, contact forms, search, comments, etc.) do NOT
  run in this export. Only existing rendered HTML, CSS, JS, and media are
  preserved.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- If a page looks wrong compared to the live WordPress site:
  - Confirm that it renders correctly on the live site first.
  - Re‑run the export after clearing any page cache on the live site.
- If some images or CSS are missing:
  - Check that the referenced files exist under assets/ and that the
    relative paths in the HTML still point into assets/.
- If a browser opens a ZIP instead of the site:
  - Make sure you extracted the ZIP files. You must upload the extracted
    .html and assets/ files, not the ZIP archives themselves.

Version

This README describes the stable version of the "WP To Dynamic HTML (Portable
Export)" plugin as of 2025‑12‑22, matching the code currently in
wp-to-dynamic-html.php that successfully produces distinct HTML pages and
split ZIP archives under the configured hosting limits.
